# Guaranteed Rate Programming Challenge for Team One Loan

Thanks for your interest in joining the One Loan Team here at Guaranteed Rate.  Part of our evaluation process for potential team members is to have you submit code.  Please provide a solution to one or more of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) challenges.  Please submit your solution(s) in a single repository via one of these methods:

 * an email to [Team One Loan](mailto:chris.hapgood@rate.com) with a link to a fork of this repo.
 * an email to [Team One Loan](mailto:chris.hapgood@rate.com) with a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) (*not* a simpel zip) of your solution's repository.
 * a PR for this repo.

If you are new to Clojure, we don't expect perfectly idiomatic code.  Instead, we want to see the decisions you have made and the rationale behind them (via comments or other documentation).  If you are an experienced Clojure developer, show us.

You are free to choose any challenge (or challenges) that you feel allows you to show off your knowledge of Clojure.  [Number 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7) is popular, and we can also recommend [number 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4).
